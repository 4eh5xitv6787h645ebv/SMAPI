# Linux graphical installer shell

The first Linux desktop shell is an Avalonia application which presents the existing installer operation names without copying installation rules into the UI. This slice deliberately has no production installer-session abstraction or protocol adapter.

This initial slice is **always a safe demo**. It uses deterministic synthetic folder and release options, holds its app log in memory, doesn't connect the production backend, and performs no installer-controlled game/package discovery or mutation and no app-initiated download or network request. The execute control is intentionally disabled; previewing an operation never claims it completed.

Avalonia and the operating-system desktop stack still make their normal infrastructure accesses. Depending on the session, those can include X11, D-Bus/AT-SPI, fonts, and Mesa or toolkit caches. The safety boundary here is the absent installer backend and fixed synthetic app data, not a claim that the GUI process makes no system calls or reads/writes no runtime state.

## Build and run on Linux

Install the .NET 10 SDK and the normal desktop libraries required by Avalonia for your distribution. From the repository root:

```sh
dotnet restore src/SMAPI.Installer.Gui/SMAPI.Installer.Gui.csproj
dotnet build src/SMAPI.Installer.Gui/SMAPI.Installer.Gui.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet run --project src/SMAPI.Installer.Gui/SMAPI.Installer.Gui.csproj --configuration Release --no-build -- --demo
```

The supported first desktop path is X11, including XWayland on Wayland sessions; Avalonia's experimental native Wayland path isn't advertised as supported yet. The window uses native controls, unique access keys and an explicit forward/reverse tab order, a visible focus ring, automation headings and a concise live result, and device-independent sizing. Selection and state cards stack below 850 device-independent pixels; the page remains vertically scrollable without horizontal page scrolling at the tested 100%, 125%, 150%, and 200% scale models.

Run the focused tests with:

```sh
dotnet test src/SMAPI.Installer.Gui.Tests/SMAPI.Installer.Gui.Tests.csproj --configuration Release
build/scripts/test-linux-gui-demo-smoke.sh
```

The tests cover the disconnected view model, synthetic session invariants, fixed display bounds and control/bidirectional-character rejection, exact Core operation coverage, launch argument safety, real access-key and Tab/Shift+Tab invocation, automation names/headings/live status, disabled execution, contrast, and arranged/rendered layouts at the scale models and narrow viewport. The process smoke runs the built shell for five seconds under Xvfb with disposable `HOME` and XDG directories; it isn't a general operating-system sandbox or a substitute for the later installer integration tests.

## Current boundary and next integration

The view model accepts only the exact internal sealed `DemoInstallerFrontendSession` type. Its fixed constants are bounded and validated against control, bidirectional-format, and surrogate characters. It returns only synthetic choices and an unchanged durable state without touching operating-system services. There is no public extension point which can be mistaken for a reviewed production authority boundary.

A separate future slice must design a bounded, asynchronous, cancellable, and disposable production adapter around the versioned Core protocol, including authoritative plan/progress/terminal-event rendering and failure cleanup. That adapter must not reimplement path ownership, trust, confirmation, transaction, backup, rollback, or recovery policy in the GUI. Until it and its security/integration tests land, this shell is a visual and accessibility preview only. Its screenshot illustrates this demo shell, not the final packaged GUI or completed release workflow. The existing non-GUI/manual installation path remains the supported path and is unchanged by this project.
